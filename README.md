We're a team of developers and creators that create things for Minecraft and Discord communities, and our own server, Orchid Towny. 
See some of our projects below: 
## Hyacinth Hello

We needed ways to query Minecraft servers, fetch Discord user information, and more in our staff tools and websites. So, we threw together this tool.
